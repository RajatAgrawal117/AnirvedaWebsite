Even popcorn and soft drinks, which once cost ₹300, now crossed ₹600. The rising costs weren't just affecting audiences—theater owners struggled with higher electricity bills, rent, and staff wages, while film producers faced rising production and marketing expenses due to cost-push inflation.Meanwhile, with the rise of OTT platforms, many viewers, including Arjun, started skipping theaters, further impacting the industry. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had been adjusting monetary policies to control inflation, but the entertainment sector still faced challenges. To help stabilize prices and encourage spending in the cinema industry, what should be the RBI's most effective economic policy decision?",
